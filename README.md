- an app idea that you would like to build
- I want to develop a productivity app for automated check-ins. I've tried several check-in apps before, but they all eventually failed because I found it to be an additional task to clock in after completing each job. It felt like a "penalty" even though I had clearly accomplished the task. I aim to create an efficiency-focused app that automatically logs completed tasks for individuals every day. Only those who haven't completed their tasks would need to manually undo the previous day's check-in on the following day.
